# RSpec Workshop

The goal of this repository is to supply easy to understand, un-tested code for you to write specs for.
Each directory under the `lib` directory contains one or more Ruby files with Ruby classes defined in them.
You are required to add corresponding specs files under the `spec` directory.

*Note:* it is advised that the `spec` directory follows the same directories structure such as lib.
Also, RSpec expects that each spec file ends with `_spec` - e.g., `person_spec.rb`.

## Work Steps
 
* Clone this repo to your local machine.
* Run `bundle install`
* For each directory under `lib` ("challenge"), implement the corresponding specs under `spec`.
* Run `rspec` to get feedback about your specs.
